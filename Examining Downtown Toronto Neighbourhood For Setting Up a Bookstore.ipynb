Located entirely within the district of Old Toronto, it is approximately 14 square kilometers in area, bounded by Bloor Street to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, the Don Valley to the east, and Bathurst Street to the west. It is also the governmental centre of the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario. \n",

We have explored the venue data obtained from Foursquare API and the data obtained by scraping the web. We have then applied various plotting and machine learning techniques to further explore the insights. We find that bookstores are not as common as coffee shops or restaurants. There are only nearly 10 bookstores in Downtown Toronto Neighbourhood. This study can be used to decide whether a location is suitable for setting up a bookstore or not. "
